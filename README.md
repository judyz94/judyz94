### Hello, my name is Judy Zapata

I'm a full stack software developer for more than two years. I develop with PHP with Laravel on the back side and with Vue.js, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap on the front side.

I have been more focused working on the backend, however, I find myself learning and expanding my knowledge on the frontend as well.
